      "The skincare section of any store can seem overwhelming – from what kind of cleanser to use to which is serum is right to address your skin concern. We asked Kim Chang, licensed aesthetician with the Aesthetics Studio at Baylor Medicine, for tips on how to create a simple skincare routine, what items should you add in and more.\n Q: What makes up a simple skincare routine?\n A: The basic three: cleanse, moisturize and protect with sunscreen. It’s super simple but gets the job done. In the morning, cleanse your skin to start the day then put on a moisturizing sunscreen. At night, cleanse your skin again to remove any residual makeup and sweat from the day then  finish with a moisturizer. That’s only two products in the morning, and two products at night. Simple!\n Q: What is something you would recommend adding to your routine?\n A: Depending on your goal, such as reducing dark spots or acne flare-ups, adding an exfoliator at least three times a week to your regimen would be beneficial. Exfoliators with lactic acid, glycolic acid or even Retin-A are great. Different from just cleansing and protecting, exfoliating will cause actual change in your skin. I would also recommend a vitamin C serum, which is an antioxidant that helps prevent damage from free radicals in the skin that can cause premature aging. Before starting something new, take an unfiltered photo outside in natural light. Then take another picture three months later in the same location and lighting to see if the products are working for your skin.\n Q: You see many people online touting multistep skincare routines. Will that same routine work for my skin?\n A: There’s really no “one-size fits all” routine. We all have our own specific  skincare goals, and your routine should be customized to meet those goals.",

      "‘Natural’ or ‘organic’ doesn't ensure the product is healthier, safer, or better for your skin. This time we discuss what are natural skin care products. The question is: are these products actually good for you and your skin.",

      "Often, the terms “nontoxic” or “natural” suggest that the product is free of synthetic chemicals that may be linked to health problems or that many people get irritated by (or both), says Jennifer Chwalek, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Union Square Laser Dermatology in New York City. These chemicals may include fragrance, dyes, and certain preservatives, such as parabens, she says. But that’s more of a consumer perception than a promise.\n Natural or organic doesn’t ensure the product is healthier, safer, or better for your skin. “These terms don’t mean hypoallergenic,” for instance, says the dermatologist Rebecca Kazin, MD, an assistant professor in the department of dermatology at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. (The “hypoallergenic” label suggests the product is less likely to cause an allergic reaction, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA].) What’s more, if you have a sensitive complexion, natural products won’t automatically fix your skin woes. “If a patient is having a problem with their skin, I may suggest they try a product where I know exactly what the ingredients are, that they should not have a reaction to,” Dr. Kazin says.\n After all, plant-based ingredients cause irritation all the time, says Dr. Garshick. Poison ivy is the classic example. While no one is making a cream with poison ivy in it, natural products often contain essential oils that can trigger a similar skin reaction. Two common culprits: limonene and bitter orange, says Dr. Chwalek. And Bergamot is an oil that can make skin more sun-sensitive, she adds.\n",

      "Natural skincare at home includes using beauty methodologies that have been passed down by our elders from generations before, which can be used onto the skin without having to worry about their side effects. Remember your grandmother’s Nushke (Recipes)? How during your childhood she used these Nushkes to treat a lot of concerns that you might have – be it a rash, dry skin, acne or even chapped lips? The list can go on. \n So if you’ve always wondered how to get naturally glowing skin, these natural and sustainable remedies will be your go-to answer:\n #1: Transformative Turmeric\n The Turmeric spice, also known as Haldi in India, has been used since time immemorial as food and medicine — and is a classic ingredient for building immunity. During Indian weddings, especially the pre-wedding ceremony — ‘Haldi’, ‘Tel Baan’ or ‘Manjha’ — Turmeric is used on the couples’ faces as it is believed to be auspicious and bestows exceptional radiance to the skin. It also contains both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n #2: Multani Mitti To The Rescue\n Multani Mitti or Fuller’s Earth is one of the most widely used ingredients to treat oily, acne-prone and blemished skin. Considered to be an eminent exfoliating agent, it has active ingredients that absorb oil, dirt, dust and impurities to purify and calm the skin.\n Since organically-made Multani Mitti might be a little tricky to find, we at Forest Essentials have perfected the formula and bottled it in a jar so that you don’t have to worry about making it on your own! Our Multani Mitti Facial Ubtan is made by sun-drying and hand-pounding fresh herbs including Neem, Fenugreek, Turmeric, Lodhra Bark, Sweet Almond Seed and Banyan Bark — and its alkaline content helps correct imbalances and neutralizes the skin tone.\n #3: Rosewater And Its Novel Applications\n Known to act as an astringent that hydrates and tightens the face’s pores, Rosewater or Gulaab Jal is an ideal naturally-derived ingredient that is known to calm irritated and blotchy skin. Known in the tenets of Ayurveda to balance Sadhaka Pitta, which in turn controls our emotions and makes us happier, Rosewater brings out the skin’s natural glow. Though there are several ways to create Rosewater at home, we recommend using pure Rosewater prepared via the process of steam distillation. \n",

      "You’ve probably come across videos of beauty gurus and influencers sharing their 7-, 8- or 10-step skincare rituals where they use a bunch of products starting from a cleanser all the way to a facial oil or SPF or perhaps both. Dr Niketa Sonavane, celebrity dermatologist and founder of Ambrosia Aesthetics, decodes the term: Layering is a skincare ritual that originated in Asia. This technique entails applying various cosmetic products to the face in a specific order. We have a tendency to believe that it is only popular among South Korean and Japanese women, but it is actually very popular across the continent. \n “Layering your skincare products simply means applying the right product in a methodical manner to achieve the best results,” explains Dr Sonavane. “If you do not apply ingredients in the correct order, you might reduce their effectiveness or cause irritation, inflammation or breakouts.” After all, applying an essence or toner on top of a moisturiser or face oil means it will bounce back or sit on top instead of seeping into the skin. “To get the best results from your skincare, layer your products in the correct order. The more layers you include in your routine, the more you accomplish by addressing your skin's needs and problems,” adds Dr Sonavane.\n We all know that the rule of thumb is to go from thinnest to thickest. “The reason for this is absorption; if a thicker, richer formula is applied first, it might prevent thinner ones from penetrating,” says Dr Sonavane. “Apply your products in the following order – cleanser, toner/essence, treatment/mask, serum, eye cream, moisturiser, oil and, finally, SPF,” she adds. “Sunscreen is always applied last, and the only thing you should layer over it is powder, concealer, or foundation.",
